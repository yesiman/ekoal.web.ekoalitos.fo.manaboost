  "readme": "[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design)\n[![gratipay](https://img.shields.io/gratipay/FezVrasta.svg)](https://gratipay.com/FezVrasta)\n[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/bootstrap-material-design.svg)](https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design)\n\n[![banner](demo/imgs/banner.jpg)](#)\n\nThis Bootstrap theme is an easy way to use the new [Material Design guidelines by Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) in your Bootstrap 3 based application.\nJust include the theme, after the Bootstrap CSS and include the JavaScript at the end of your document (just before the `</body>` tag), and everything will be converted to Material Design (Paper) style.\n\n**NOTE**: This theme is still in development, it could be used on production websites but I can't guarantee compatibility with previous versions.\n\nCheck out [the demo at this link](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/).\n\n## How to install\n\nYou may install this theme using Bower or Meteor:\n\n- Bower : `bower install bootstrap-material-design`\n- Meteor: `meteor add fezvrasta:bootstrap-material-design`\n\nIf you prefer, you can include this framework in your project using our official CDN:\n\n- [Bootstrap Material Design on CDNJS.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/bootstrap-material-design)\n- [Bootstrap Material Design on JSDelivr.com](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!bootstrap.material-design)\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nNavigate to the `dist/` folder in this repository, and you will see the `test.html` file, which has the CSS include statements, in the `head` section and the JS includes just before `body` section closes.\nYou need to copy the `dist/` folder to the root of your project, ensuring that all the files in your project can access the files through the relative URL, supplied in the CSS and the JS includes.\n\n#### material-fullpalette.css or material.css?\n\nThe only difference is that `material-fullpalette.css` has the full colors palette available, the other one has just the primary colors.\n\n#### Use custom color as primary\n\nIs often asked how to change the primary color of this theme without edit the bower package directly.\n\nYou can do it by creating a less file in your project:\n\n    @import \"../bower_components/bootstrap-material-design/less/material-wfont.less\";\n\n    // Override @primary color with one took from _colors.less\n    @primary: @deep-purple;\n\nThen, compiling this file, the entire theme will be compiled using the color chosen by you.\n\n## Development\n\nWe are using Grunt to automate the workflow and build process. Ensure you have nodejs installed and grunt-cli installed globally.\nAfter cloning the repo, run `npm install` to ensure you have all dev dependencies.\n\nRun the `grunt build` command to run the tests and compile the less/sass. See [Gruntfile.js](Gruntfile.js) for details on targets.\n\nRun the `grunt test` command for browser-based Jasmine unit tests.\n\nRun the `grunt serve` command to build and fire up an http server with live-reload and a watch for development purposes.\n\n### LESS & SASS\n\nCurrently only LESS is maintained. The SASS version no longer has a maintainer (#256).\nThe SASS files are in the source just in case someone wants to update the source from SASS and use these files as a base.\n\n## Support me\n\nIf you like this project you may support me by donating something on Gittip, starring this repository or reporting bugs and ideas in the issue section.\n\n[![gittip](demo/imgs/gittip-button.jpg)](https://www.gratipay.com/FezVrasta/)\n[![issues](demo/imgs/issues-button.jpg)](https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design/issues)\n\n## Contribute\n\nPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n\n# Documentation\n\nMaterial Design for Bootstrap provides some additional stuff to get the best from Material Design.\n\n### Variations\n\nThere are 17 additional color variations (in addition to the classic 4 variations) for buttons, inputs, checkboxes, radios, alerts, navbars, tabs, labels, paginations, progress bars and more.\nThey can be used by adding the class suffix `-material-color` to the desired element and replacing `color` with the desired one.\n\nExample:\n\n    <button class=\"btn btn-material-deep-purple\">Deep purple button</button>\n\nThese colors are taken from the Material Design color palette and are reported below:\n\n![palette](demo/imgs/palette.jpg)\n\nTo take advantage of all the shades please use `material-fullpalette.css`, be aware of its huge size.\n\n### Buttons\n\nAdd `.btn-flat` to a button to make it flat, without shadows.\nAdd `.btn-raised` to a button to add a permanent shadow to it.\n\n### Inputs\n\nAdd `.floating-label` to an input field with a `placeholder` to transform the placeholder in a floating label.\n\nAdd `data-hint=\"some hint\"` to show an hint under the input when the user focus it.\n\nRemember to use the proper HTML markup to get radio and checkboxes styled correctly (choose between *radio* or *checkbox*):\n\n    <div class=\"radio/checkbox radio-primary\">\n        <label>\n            <input type=\"radio/checkbox\" checked>\n            Option one is this\n        </label>\n    </div>\n\n### Icons\n\nMaterial Design for Bootstrap includes 490 original Material Design icons!\nThese icons are extracted from the original Google sources and are licensed under the BSD license.\nThey are provided as an iconic and easy to use font.\n\nVariations are available for every icon, including the original Bootstrap icons.\n\nThe syntax to add a Material icon is:\n\n     <i class=\"icon icon-material-favorite\"></i>\n\n## Material.js\n\n`Material.js` is a jQuery plugin that adds some magic to your markup and allows Material Design for Bootstrap to style some elements like inputs, checkboxes, radios etc.\n\n### Functions\n\n* `$.material.init()` - shortcut to run all the following commands:\n* `$.material.ripples()` will apply ripples.js to the default elements.\n* `$.material.input()` will enable the MD style to the text inputs, and other kind of inputs (number, email, file etc).\n* `$.material.checkbox():` will enable the MD style to the checkboxes (remember to follow the markup guidelines explained in the [Inputs section](#inputs).\n* `$.material.radio():` will enable the MD style to the checkboxes (remember to follow the markup guidelines explained in the Inputs section.\n\n### Apply Material.js only to specific elements\n\nEvery function expects an optional value that will be used as a selector for the function; for example,\n`$.material.ripples(\"#selector, #foobar\")` will apply Ripples.js only to `#selector` and `#foobar`.\nThe functions that allows an optional selector are `$.material.ripples`, `$.material.input`, `$.material.checkbox` and `$.material.radio`.\n\nYou can even override the default values using the `$.material.options` function. The default values are:\n\n    $.material.options = {\n        \"withRipples\": \".btn:not(.btn-link), .card-image, .navbar a:not(.withoutripple), .nav-tabs a:not(.withoutripple), .withripple\",\n        \"inputElements\": \"input.form-control, textarea.form-control, select.form-control\",\n        \"checkboxElements\": \".checkbox > label > input[type=checkbox]\",\n        \"radioElements\": \".radio > label > input[type=radio]\"\n    }\n\n### Arrive.js support\n\nIf you need to dynamically add elements to your DOM then you may need to include `Arrive.js` before `Material.js`. This will automatically apply `Material.js` to every new element added via JavaScript.\n\n## Plugins\n\nMaterial Design for Bootstrap comes with styling support for various external scripts:\n\n### SnackbarJS\n\nCreate snackbars and toasts with the [SnackbarJS plugin](https://github.com/FezVrasta/snackbarjs). The default toast style is the squared one (snackbar style). If you like to use the rounded style (toast style), please add the `toast` class to the `style` option of SnackbarJS.\n\n### RipplesJS\n\nThis is part of the Material Design for Bootstrap project and is a plain JavaScript script which creates the ripple effect when clicking on the specified elements.\nAt the moment RipplesJS does not have its own repository but it will probably have one in the future.\n\nYou may want to set a custom color to the ripples of a specific element, to do so write:\n\n    <button class=\"btn btn-default\" data-ripple-color=\"#F0F0F0\">Custom ripple</button>\n\n### noUiSlider\n\nMake cross-browser sliders and get them styled with Material Design thanks to the support provided by this theme.\nRead more about [noUiSlider here](http://refreshless.com/nouislider/).\n\n### Dropdown.js\n\nFinally a dropdown plugin that transforms select inputs in nice dropdowns and does not drive you crazy.\nRead more about [Dropdown.js here](https://github.com/FezVrasta/dropdown.js).\n\n### Selectize.js\n\nTransform select and multi-select inputs into advanced text inputs. Material Design for BS provides a full replacement of the plugin's CSS, so don't include it.\nRead more about [selectize.js](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nCurrently, Material Design for Bootstrap supports Google Chrome (tested v37+), Mozilla Firefox (tested 30+), and Internet Explorer (tested 11+). Mobile browsers are not currently tested but they may work.\n",
